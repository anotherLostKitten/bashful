# BASHFUL

a shell except it's shelldon from big bang theory (bazinga)

# FEATURES
exit (95% success rate)

cd (it really kind of works)

executing arbitrary commands (Ain't that cool?)

I have already made a commit and push to this repo using only the shell... the only problem was that the shell does not yet understand that text within quotes is a single argument, and therefore the commit message had a lot of underlines and was ugly

# ALMOST FEATURES

# WE PRETEND THESE ARE FEATURES

i think quitting the shell segfaults on occasion...

# CONJUNCTION JUNCTION?

What in truth is your function?

Dost thou hooketh up yon words, yon phrases and clauses?
